            Roxana provides <b>an easy way</b> to create and keep your own <b>business exceptions</b> and <b>business messages</b>.
            It also offers support to Constraint Validation on Spring Rest projects.
            
            Business exceptions and <b>Constraint Validation</b> are treated as <b>user's friendly messages</b>. 
            All user's friendly messages could be <b>internationalized</b> following the <b>i18n pattern</b>.

            <b>REST</b> is a popular technology nowadays, much of it is due to the ease of 
            implementation and its flexibility.

            However, in a long-term usage of this technology, it is crucial to keep a 
            <b>standard of URI nomenclature</b>, request and response <b>Json objects</b>, HTTP methods and HTTP responses codes, 
            not forgetting to always keep the source code as clean and simple as possible. 
            All theses points could be used to measure the quality of a <b>REST API</b>.
        </p>

            As a developer, I <b>spent a lot of effort to standardize my APIs</b> and keep things 
            like throws and treat <b>business exceptions</b> and <b>internationalization</b> painless.
            
            When working with <b>Spring technologies</b> for the first time, I saw the opportunity 
            to solve these problems and create an <b>open source</b> framework to make my solutions 
            <b>reusable</b> and <b>shareable</b> with developers all around the world.
